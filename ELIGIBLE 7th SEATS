//There are N seats in a cricket stadium. As part of the promotions for a match, every 7th seat gets a 7-up T-shirt. The first 200 seats are allocated for VIPs and last 400 seats are unreserved. These seats are not eligible for the T-shirts. Write a c++ program to find out which seats are eligible to get T-shirt in the upcoming match.
